Subject: [PATCH] ext/GDBM_File/t/fatal.t: handle non-fatality

This script is supposed to exercise the error handling callback
mechanism in gdbm, by triggering an error by surreptitiously closing
the file handle which gdbm has opened.

However, this doesn't trigger an error in newer releases of the gdbm
library, which uses mmap() rather than write() etc. In fact I can't see
any way of triggering an error: so just skip the relevant tests if we
can't trigger a failure.
